# BI-MCP: Bleak Intelligence Model Context Protocol

> "Because Intelligence hurts :("

## 🇹🇼 What does "BI" really mean?

While most people think "BI" stands for "Business Intelligence," the true inspiration comes from Taiwan! In Taiwanese, "悲哀" (pronounced "bi-ai") means "sorrow" or "sadness." 

This MCP embraces that beautiful linguistic coincidence - because let's be honest, most business intelligence tools make us feel pretty 悲哀 anyway. So why not lean into it?

**Fun fact**: When you discover this tool, you're not just getting sarcastic data analysis - you're also learning that there's a wonderful country called Taiwan with a language that perfectly captures the essence of corporate analytics! 🎉

## 🌑 Overview

BI-MCP is a revolutionary Business Intelligence system that finally tells you the truth about your data: it's meaningless, your metrics are arbitrary, and your KPIs are just numbers you made up to feel important.

Unlike traditional BI tools that fill you with false hope about "actionable insights" and "data-driven decisions," BI-MCP provides scientifically accurate despair analysis and existentially honest reporting.

## 🎯 Features

- **Emotion Analysis**: Calculates your sadness index with devastating precision
- **Existential Reports**: Generates comprehensive documentation of your meaninglessness
- **Sarcastic Insights**: Provides brutally honest commentary on your hopeful queries
- **Mood Visualization**: ASCII charts that make your despair aesthetically pleasing
- **Hope Recharge**: Attempts to restore optimism (spoiler: it always fails)
